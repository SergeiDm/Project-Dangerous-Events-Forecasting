# The Project Dangerous Events Forecasting
##	Description of the problem
Forecasting events like terrorist attacks, conflicts, and any other mass violence can help to assess a risk and take a measure to prevent them. Nowadays we have datasets with description of events from around the world, automatically collecting information from the Internet mass media sources. Can we predict the future events with this given information? Let’s consider a certain country – France and time period 2013-04-01 – 2016-09-03.
